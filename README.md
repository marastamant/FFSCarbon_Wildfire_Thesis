Wildfire Fuel Treatments and Long-Term Carbon Storage in CA Forests

The central research question of this study is if fuel-reduction treatments can increase long-term net carbon storage by preventing wildfire in California mixed conifer forest (MCF). More specifically, I aim to answer the following subquestions: (1) How do repeated fuel treatments (mechanical thinning, and/or prescribed fire) directly affect aboveground carbon stocks over time? (2) How do repeated fuel treatments (mechanical thinning, and/or prescribed fire) affect predicted aboveground carbon stocks following modeled high-severity wildfire? (3) How does the probability of wildfire affect net aboveground carbon stocks of treated forests? To assess these questions, my data collection objective will be to collect primary data (tree, fuels, and understory data) from the Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) Study of Blodgett Research Forest. I will also use this primary data to produce secondary modeled data using Forest Vegetation Simulator (Fire and Fuels Extension).
